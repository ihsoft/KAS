		// ********** Part: KAS.CH1

		#KAS_CH1_Part_title = CH-1 Cable Hook
		#KAS_CH1_Part_manufacturer = KAS Labs, Inc.
		#KAS_CH1_Part_description = A hook that a cable can clip onto. It's the other half of the "keep-these-things-together" solution.
		#KAS_CH1_Part_tags = KIS KAS cable rope tie cck-kas

		// ********** Part: KAS.GrapplingHook

		#KAS_GrapplingHook_Part_title = HG-02 Grappling Hook
		#KAS_GrapplingHook_Part_manufacturer = KAS
		#KAS_GrapplingHook_Part_description = Everyone liked the idea of "harpooning" objects in space. However, the harpoon could not cope with the station modules - after all, they are made of metal. Gene suggested a solution: replace the harpoon with a suction cup. It worked, but it's no longer a harpoon.
		#KAS_GrapplingHook_Part_tags = KIS KAS hook harpoon attachment winch eject cck-kas
		#KAS_GrapplingHook_Part_DetachDartEventText = Detach grappling device

		// ********** Part: KAS.Harpoon

		#KAS_Harpoon_Part_title = HP-01 Harpoon
		#KAS_Harpoon_Part_manufacturer = KAS
		#KAS_Harpoon_Part_description = This idea was proposed by Bill when he returned from vacation. He hunted at sea with a harpoon gun. He didn’t hit anything, of course, but the desire to “harpoon” something remained. Why not some asteroid in space? And so this space harpoon appeared. By the way, it can even harpoon a planet.
		#KAS_Harpoon_Part_tags = KIS KAS hook harpoon attachment winch eject cck-kas
		#KAS_Harpoon_Part_DetachDartEventText = Detach harpoon

		// ********** Part: KAS.JS1

		#KAS_JS1_Part_title = JS-1 Joint Socket
		#KAS_JS1_Part_manufacturer = KAS Labs, Inc.
		#KAS_JS1_Part_description = This multi-purpose socket has a variety of features: it allows a firm connection and provides for the transfer of resources! A certified engineer with multiple years of experience is required to install this socket, but once attached, even a janitor can use it to connect vessels.
		#KAS_JS1_Part_tags = KIS KAS pipe tube cck-kas

		// ********** Part: KAS.PCB1

		#KAS_PCB1_Part_title = PCB-1 Portable Cable Bracing
		#KAS_PCB1_Part_manufacturer = KAS Labs, Inc.
		#KAS_PCB1_Part_description = It's a simple manually-operated winch with a small spool of steel cable, which lets you connect things as long as they are not too far away. There must be a hook on the other vessel on which to attach the cable, however, so this winch only solves half the problem.
		#KAS_PCB1_Part_tags = KIS KAS cable rope tie cck-kas
		#KAS_PCB1_Part_LinkBreak = Unlink
		#KAS_PCB1_Part_LinkStart = Link

		// ********** Part: KAS.PortPylon

		#KAS_PortPylon_Part_title = GP-20 Pylon
		#KAS_PortPylon_Part_manufacturer = KAS Labs, Inc.
		#KAS_PortPylon_Part_description = Our RTS-1 product line was a huge success! However, there were a couple complaints; it turns out that sometimes the pipe just isn't long enough! To solve this problem, a new part was developed: a lightweight pylon with a built-in pipe socket, allowing it to act as an extender. It is thus feasible to chain resource links across long distances, though to do so, you might need to construct additional pylons. Jeb really wanted to add a Kerba-Cola refrigerator to the hollow interior, but R&D had to reject his suggestion due to a strict 20kg mass limit.
		#KAS_PortPylon_Part_tags = KAS resource fuel transfer cck-kas

		// ********** Part: KAS.PortPylonPwr

		#KAS_PortPylonPwr_Part_title = BGP-400 Pylon on Steroids
		#KAS_PortPylonPwr_Part_manufacturer = KAS Labs, Inc.
		#KAS_PortPylonPwr_Part_description = This part's design was inspired by the GP-20. Our engineers needed to know: could the internal volume of the pylon really be utilized? It turns out that it can! As such, they decided to fill it with some Z-100 batteries and a simple control module. It's not quite as cool as a Kerba-Cola fridge, as Jeb had requested, but it's still very practical. Rest assured that the batteries are of the finest quality, and not merely salvaged from the recycle bin.
		#KAS_PortPylonPwr_Part_tags = KAS resource fuel transfer cck-kas

		// ********** Part: KAS.RTS1

		#KAS_RTS1_Part_title = RTS-1 Resource Transfer Station
		#KAS_RTS1_Part_manufacturer = KAS Labs, Inc.
		#KAS_RTS1_Part_description = This pipe allows for the transfer of resources between vessels. The diameter is not that impressive, but as a small green fellow once said, "Size matters not." Our patented technology allows the transfer of any number of things through it, including, but not limited to: rocks, fuel, snacks, and even kerbals. Warranty void in the latter case.
		#KAS_RTS1_Part_tags = KIS KAS resource fuel transfer cck-kas

		// ********** Part: KAS.TB60

		#KAS_TB60_Part_title = TB-60 Tow Bar
		#KAS_TB60_Part_manufacturer = KAS Labs, Inc.
		#KAS_TB60_Part_description = A simple solution for towing a vessel that cannot move by itself. If a simple rope were to be used, then the vessel under tow would likely impact the towing craft when braking or maneuvering, but with the towbar this is not the case. Moreover, it can assist in steering the towed vessel, if applicable. Be sure to keep the batteries fresh, else the active steering won't work.
		#KAS_TB60_Part_tags = KIS KAS pipe tube tow towbar cck-kas
		#KAS_TB60_Part_LinkBreak = Disconnect vessels
		#KAS_TB60_Part_LinkStart = Attach to a vessel
		#KAS_TB60_Part_Park_Forward = Park: FORWARD
		#KAS_TB60_Part_Park_Up = Park: UP

		// ********** Part: KAS.TJ1

		#KAS_TJ1_Part_title = TJ-1 Fixed Telescopic Joint
		#KAS_TJ1_Part_manufacturer = KAS Labs, Inc.
		#KAS_TJ1_Part_description = This simple telescoping strut can rigidly connect two vessels. The maximum connection distance is fairly short, but its strength is adequate. The design was inspired by a selfie stick Jeb bought at a thrift store.
		#KAS_TJ1_Part_tags = KIS KAS pipe tube cck-kas
		#KAS_TJ1_Part_LinkBreak = Disconnect vessels
		#KAS_TJ1_Part_LinkStart = Attach to a vessel

		#KAS_TJ1_Part_Park_Up = Park: UP

		// ********** Part: KAS.TJ2

		#KAS_TJ2_Part_title = TJ-2 Free Telescopic Joint
		#KAS_TJ2_Part_manufacturer = KAS Labs, Inc.
		#KAS_TJ2_Part_description = It's the same TJ-1 "Selfie Stick", except the hinges are unlocked. Truly the best solution to keep connected vessels separated from each other, yet not overly restricting their movements.
		#KAS_TJ2_Part_tags = KIS KAS pipe tube cck-kas
		#KAS_TJ2_Part_LinkBreak = Disconnect vessels
		#KAS_TJ2_Part_LinkStart = Attach to a vessel
		#KAS_TJ2_Part_Park_Down = Park: DOWN

		#KAS_TJ2_Part_Park_Up = Park: UP

		// ********** Part: KAS.W1

		#KAS_W1_Part_title = W-50 Winch
		#KAS_W1_Part_manufacturer = KAS Labs, Inc.
		#KAS_W1_Part_description = An ancient sage once said: "Give me the right socket, and with a winch I'll pull Kerbin". This winch is not quite that strong, though it can lift up or tow a rather bulky vessel. Remember to attach a compatible socket on the target craft. Also, make sure there is enough power on the active vessel: the winch is hungry for electricity!
		#KAS_W1_Part_tags = KIS KAS winch cable connector cck-kas

		// ********** Part: KAS.W2

		#KAS_W2_Part_title = HW-80 Winch
		#KAS_W2_Part_manufacturer = KAS Labs, Inc.
		#KAS_W2_Part_description = A heavy duty version of the W-50 winch model. It has extra cable and features improved connection strength. However, it still cannot pull Kerbin. Note: warranty void if winches are used to winch witches, and it doesn't matter which winch or which witch.
